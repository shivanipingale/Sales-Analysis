# Conclusion
The sales analysis revealed that the majority of sales come from consumers in the Office Supplies category and the Phones sub-category.

To boost sales, strategic offers can be introduced for online payments or business strategies can be optimized for COD.
A Year-over-Year (YoY) monthly profit comparison shows that profits in October and December 2019 were higher than in 2020. However, in 2020, sales showed an increasing trend from November to December. Introducing promotional offers during these months can help maximize sales and improve profitability.
